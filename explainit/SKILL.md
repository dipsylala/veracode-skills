  - User wants to understand a specific CVE, Flaw ID, or vulnerability type (XSS, SQL injection, path traversal, etc.)
  - User asks what a flaw means or why it is a risk

# Security Flaw Explainer

Help developers understand security vulnerabilities identified by Veracode — what the flaw is, why it matters, and how it could be exploited — without overwhelming them with jargon.

**Core Principles**: Educate while you guide

## Identify the ID type

### Flaw IDs — first-party SAST findings

A flaw ID is a numeric identifier, optionally with a pipeline suffix:
- Plain numeric: `12345`
- With pipeline suffix: `12345-1`

### CVE / SCA IDs — third-party dependency findings

A third-party vulnerability identifier starts with `cve-` or `sid-` (case-insensitive), for example `CVE-2021-44228` or `sid-12345`.

## Retrieving flaw details

**For numeric flaw IDs only** (`12345` or `12345-1`), retrieve remediation guidance using the flaw ID. This single call retrieves all necessary details — do not also call finding-details separately, as the remediation guidance response already includes that information.

**For CVE / SCA IDs** (`cve-` or `sid-` prefixes), do not use remediation guidance (it only works with pipeline flaw IDs). Instead:
1. Check whether local SCA scan results already in context contain data for this CVE.
2. If prior SCA context is available, use it to explain the vulnerability.
3. If no prior context exists, retrieve local SCA findings filtered by the CVE identifier to get component name, affected version, CVSS score, EPSS score, and fix version.

## Presenting the explanation

Use the retrieved flaw details to explain:

1. **What the vulnerability is and where it exists** — describe the flaw class (SQL injection, XSS, path traversal, etc.) in plain language and identify the affected file, function, or line number if available.

2. **Why it's a risk** — reference the CWE identifier and explain the real-world impact if exploited (data exposure, code execution, privilege escalation, denial of service, etc.).

3. **What makes this code exploitable** — identify the specific unsafe pattern, missing validation, or improper API usage that creates the vulnerability (e.g., "line 42 concatenates user input directly into the SQL query").

4. **How to address it** — summarize the general remediation approach (e.g., "use parameterized queries," "validate and sanitize input," "apply context-aware encoding"). Keep this brief and conceptual — detailed step-by-step fixes belong to the `/fixit` skill.

5. **Related best practices** — mention relevant secure coding patterns for the language/framework, OWASP guidelines, or security principles that prevent this class of vulnerability.

Keep explanations concise, educational, and grounded in the developer's context. Avoid unnecessary acronyms or academic references unless the user asks for deeper detail.
